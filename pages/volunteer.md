Minnesota Voyageur Trail Ultra and the Eugene Curnow Trail Marathon are in need of volunteers! Time commitments vary and some of the work can be appropriate for all ages; this is a great way to introduce friends and family to the world of trail running. Most important, volunteers have an absolute blast supporting racers, meeting new people, and giving back to the trail running community.

If you are volunteering as part of a job, education, or race requirement we will be happy to complete any necessary paperwork to verify your time commitment at our event.

If you have any questions, please contact our Volunteer Coordinator using our [contact page](/contact).

> Note: If for some reason your ability to volunteer changes, please notify us right away. We rely on all of our volunteers to help us provide a successful event.

# Curnow volunteer sign-up form

Volunteering at the Eugene Curnow Trail Marathon gets you a discounted entry to the Minnesota Voyageur. A very nice benefit, indeed! But… please do not sign up for volunteering just for the discount and then back out. It places us in a short-handed situation. We do audit these post-race and contact no-shows to square up.

# High-priority needs

* **Aid Station Volunteers (This is a biggie!)**
  <br>This is far and away our biggest need every year! Fortunately, it’s also one of the most fun things to do on race day. Assemble a group of friends to volunteer for the day, or just bring yourself and make some great new friends – all while providing the most essential contribution to race day success for our runners!
  <br>A couple of aid stations may require monitoring / assistance with road crossings. This is generally handled in shifts. We only have a couple of crossings, but their busy nature makes this aspect extremely important.

# Other opportunities

* Click into the sign-up form above for a complete list of opportunities.

* **Specialties: Medical/First Aid**
  <br>A level of medical training is preferred – e.g. doctor, nurse, EMT, formal first-aid training, or similar.
