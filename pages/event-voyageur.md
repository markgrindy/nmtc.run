  Founded in 1982, the Minnesota Voyageur 50 Mile Trail Ultramarathon is one of the oldest trail ultras in the nation. The race follows a rugged, varied, out-and-back course that takes runners on a journey from Carlton, MN, through Jay Cooke State Park, and heads northeast over difficult, rough woodland trails to Duluth, MN—and back. Enjoy scenic overlooks of Lake Superior and cross the iconic Swinging Bridge over the St. Louis River. </br></br>Carlton High School hosts the start, finish, and race-day festivities. Weather for the Minnesota Voyageur can be extreme. There have been several years when it was hot and humid—including 2003 when it was brutally hot with 90 percent humidity. In other years it has been cool, in the mid-50’s, and wet. Plan for everything except snow—at least not so far!

> **ATTENTION:** Runners’ crews and spectators are not allowed at Hwy 210 (water) or Peterson’s aid stations! Failure to adhere to this will result in runner disqualification! As a runner participant you are responsible for your crew and spectators understanding this limitation.  

**Aid station items:**
* Drinks include water, an electrolyte drink, and various sodas.
* Food includes fruit, cookies, potato chips, and other sweet/salty options.
* We do not supply electrolyte supplement capsules, such as Endurolytes or S-Caps.
* We highly recommend you carry water during the race, e.g. bottle or other hydration system.

# Drop bags

* Note available drop bag locations on the [aid station](#aid-stations) chart.
* Please keep your drop bags reasonable in size.
* You must label drop bags with your name and race number. Do this at home so you don’t have to worry about it on race morning. Duct tape and a Sharpie marker work well. Unmarked bags will not be delivered to the aid station.
* At the race start location, place your clearly marked bags by the signs for each aid station, and we will deliver them to those aid stations.
* We will return your drop bags to the finish.

# Details

**Trail markings:** Follow the hot orange pin flags, with the initials “NMTC” on them. If you don’t see one in about 0.1 miles, you are off course! Turns are marked with a series of pin flags a short distance (feet) apart on the side to which you’ll be turning.

**Traffic warning:** Use care on bike paths and roads. Runners must yield to traffic when crossing roads! A race is just a run; a road crossing is life and death!  

**Footing warning:** The race is run primarily on rugged woodland singletrack with roots, rocks, and other potential hazards. Watch footing on the bridges; they can be slippery, especially when wet, and some may have boards missing.

**Cupless:** NMTC races are cup-free races. We will not provide paper cups at aid stations, and runners will need to carry their own cups (for example, collapsible cups), bottles, or other hydration vessels for use at aid stations.

**Cutoffs:** Voyageur aid stations enforce cutoffs (with the exception of the water-only Hwy 210 aid station, which has no cutoff). Please see the [aid station chart](#aid-stations) for specific cutoff times. Runners must reach the finish in 14 hours, by 8:00 PM.

**Results:** Results are posted on [Ultrasignup](https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=114070) and [MTEC](https://www.mtecresults.com/event/show/4974/).

**Photos:** Photos are often uploaded to the [Voyageur Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/minnesotavoyageur).

**Awards:** Top 10 men and women receive a pottery mug; all finishers receive a medal.

**Area events:** Coinciding with Voyageur race weekend, the city of Carlton, MN will be putting on their annual [Carlton Daze](https://carltonchamber.com/carlton-daze/) festivities, including a 5k Run/Walk, kids fun races, a spaghetti feed, and much more. Organizers really appreciate support on Friday evening, when volunteer help is always appreciated.
