We can do this—with your help! Every cent of your donation supports the continued viability of the NMTC Spring & Fall Race Series, the Eugene Curnow Marathon, and the Minnesota Voyageur Trail Ultramarathon.

Your donation supports a community. Local runners of all ages and abilities can enjoy 15 completely free and absolutely fun Spring and Fall Series events.

Your donation encourages volunteering. You enable NMTC to offer a discount to the Curnow or the Voyageur to runners who volunteer at the other race.

Your donation ensures the legend continues with one of America’s longest-running trail ultras, the Minnesota Voyageur.

Thank you for supporting the Northern Minnesota trail running community. See you on trail!
